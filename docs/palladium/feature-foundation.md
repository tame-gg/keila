# Palladium Feature Foundation

This document maps the 50 requested feature additions to concrete `/palladium features <key>` operator commands. The in-game command is the primary surface: each entry returns live server data or performs a bounded operator action instead of sending admins to external docs.

## Operator Commands

- `/palladium features` lists every runnable feature command.
- `/palladium features list [category]` filters the command list.
- `/palladium features categories` lists available categories.
- `/palladium features <KF-###|key> [args]` runs the selected feature.
- `/palladium features help` shows usage examples.
- `/palladium mspt` reports server and world MSPT without requiring parallel world ticking.
- `/palladium perf queues` shows async pathfinding queue counters.
- `/palladium perf async` shows high-risk async feature state and virtual-thread concurrency caps.
- `/palladium perf memory` shows JVM memory and processor data.
- `/palladium perf all` prints all three perf views.

## Runtime Safety Gates

The following items are intentionally runtime scaffolds until replay tests, stress tests, and soak tests exist for each behavior:

- Async chunk-send stress harness
- Packet-order replay tests
- Playerdata save ordering tests
- Config migration framework
- Per-feature rollback command
- Per-world async toggles
- Admin web status endpoint
- Sentry breadcrumbs for async failures
- Crash report Palladium section
- Entity tracker contention metrics

Each of these must satisfy the rollout gates in `docs/palladium/runtime-safety.md` before being changed from scaffold to default-enabled runtime behavior.

## Rollback Contract

Any high-risk feature must have one of these rollback paths before production use:

- a boolean config key that disables the feature after restart,
- a hot-reload-safe config path documented by the relevant `/palladium features <key>` output,
- or a safe-mode profile entry emitted by `scripts/safeModeProfile.sh`.

## Generated Catalog

The authoritative in-code catalog lives in `gg.tame.palladium.feature.PalladiumFeatureCatalog`. Tests enforce that all 50 feature entries remain present, have unique IDs, and expose a concrete surface.
